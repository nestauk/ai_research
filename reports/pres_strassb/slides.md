# Main questions we look into
- Does the private sector "harvest" the best performing AI researchers?
- After transitioning into industry, does their (publicly available) output decline?
- What does that mean for public interest, ethics, fairness and safety in emerging AI technologies?

- Critique of recent large language models
- Concerns about training data and fairness
- (Growing) Resource requirements for training as well as transparency

### Some more background:
- AI research is booming
- Growing private sector participation in AI research:
    - Google had in 2019 the highest number of accepted papers at NeurIPS
    - Standard frameworks went from being developed in academia (Theano & Caffe) to industry (Tensorflow & PyTorch)
    - Star researches leading industry AI labs
---


- Modern AI techniques require large datasets available in industry
- Potential disconnect between academic AI and industry needs forcing industry to take basic research "in their own hands"
- Tight integration of AI systems and industrial cloud platforms exploiting synergies and increasing competitiveness
- Culture allowing academic publication helps attracting scholars and running "blue-skies" research
- Ability to internalize externalities

---

### Potential risks of AI privatization

- potential homogenisation of public and private research spheres
- potential neglect of long-term negative social externalities
- steering of the trajectory towards "de-democratization" of AI due to focus on data and resource-hungry techniques rather than promotion of "leaner" approaches
- Worker displacement without productivity growth
- Fairness/bias issues

#### Possible transition mechanisms


- Researcher-push
- Technology-push
- Industry-pull

### Private vs public AI development?
- Private AI labs play an increasingly important role
- They advance AI tech but also study ethical risks
- We don't know what we don't know - not everything is pulished
- Commercial interest may not be always in line with research agendas of employees
- Start-up achquisition argument

#### Argument for bolstering public AI research 

---
### What we do in this paper
- Study bibliographic data and reconstruct AI researcher careers (~83k researchers, active  2015-2020)
- Provide descriptive analysis on researcher and output levels
- Identify "switchers"
- Survival analysis: reasons for transition into industry
- Diff-in-diff: consequences of transition
