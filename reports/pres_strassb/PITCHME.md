# Main questions we look into
- Does the private sector "harvest" the best performing AI researchers?
- After transitioning into industry, does their (publicly available) output decline?
- What does that mean for public interest, ethics, fairness and safety in emerging AI technologies?

#### **[#ISupportTimnit](https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382)**

- Renowned AI researcher Timnit Gebru dismissed from Google Brain (Ethics co-lead) in December 2020
- Disagreement with management over conference paper

- Critique of recent large language models
- Concerns about training data and fairness
- (Growing) Resource requirements for training as well as transparency

---
### Some more background:
- AI research is booming
- Growing private sector participation in AI research:
    - Google had in 2019 the highest number of accepted papers at NeurIPS
    - Standard frameworks went from being developed in academia (Theano & Caffe) to industry (Tensorflow & PyTorch)
    - Star researches leading industry AI labs
---


- Modern AI techniques require large datasets available in industry
- Potential disconnect between academic AI and industry needs forcing industry to take basic research "in their own hands"
- Tight integration of AI systems and industrial cloud platforms exploiting synergies and increasing competitiveness
- Culture allowing academic publication helps attracting scholars and running "blue-skies" research
- Ability to internalize externalities

---

### Potential risks of AI privatization

- potential homogenization of public and private research spheres
- potential neglect of long-term negative social externalities
- steering of the trajectory towards "de-democratization" of AI due to focus on data and resource-hungry techniques rather than promotion of "leaner" approaches
- Worker displacement without productivity growth
- Fairness/bias issues

#### Possible transition mechanisms


- Researcher-push
- Technology-push
- Industry-pull

### Private vs public AI development?
- Private AI labs play an increasingly important role
- They advance AI tech but also study ethical risks
- We don't know what we don't know - not everything is pulished
- Commercial interest may not be always in line with research agendas of employees
- Start-up acquisition argument

#### Argument for bolstering public AI research 

---
### What we do in this paper
- Study bibliographic data and reconstruct AI researcher careers (~83k researchers, active  2015-2020)
- Provide descriptive analysis on researcher and output levels
- Identify "switchers"
- Survival analysis: reasons for transition into industry
- Diff-in-diff: consequences of transition

# Survival Analysis

- Deep learning researchers are more likely to transition into industry
- Researchers with a more extended network in general and to colleagues in industry are more likely to transiion
- The impact of research output as measured by citations (not quantity of publications) is crucial when explaining transitions into industry

# Diff-in-diff exploring consequences

- Compared with very similar colleagues that don't transition, those researchers that do produce more impactful research (higher **cit$^{rank}$**)

- There is some indication that over time their impact decreases: Fewer publications of breakthrough research (possible); one-hit-wonder?

# All in all?
- Does the private sector "harvest" the best performing AI researchers? **Yes** ‚úÖ
- After transitioning into industry, does their (publicly available) output decline? **Possibly** ‚úÖ
- What does that mean for public interest, ethics, fairness and safety in emerging AI technologies? **Public research needs to remain attractive for star- AI-researchers** üßê


---

## Next steps for this paper
- Solidify framework
- More detailed analysis of the transition outcomes: 
    - diversity and novely ouf output
    - collaboration patterns
- From knowledge diffusion back to knowledge production?

---

## Now what - policy implication

- There is nothing wrong with impactful industry AI labs
- Better coordination and funding of public mission-oriented AI research
- Development and enforcement of guidelines / certification of AI
- What do industrial AI ethics units do? Mapping/evaluation? "Alignment"
- Where do commercial interest clash with public objectives?
